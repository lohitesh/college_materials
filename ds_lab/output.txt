Program1: 
Develop a Program in C for the following:
a)    Declare a calendar as an array of 7 elements (A dynamically Created array) to represent 7 days of a week. Each Element of the array is a structure having three fields. The first field is the name of the Day (A dynamically allocated String), The second field is the date of the Day (A integer), the third field is the description of the activity for a particular day (A dynamically allocated String).
b) Write functions create(), read() and display(); to create the calendar, to read the data from the keyboard and to print weeks activity details report on screen

Program 12: Given a File of N employee records with a set K of Keys (4-digit) which uniquely determine the records in file F. Assume that file F is maintained in memory by a Hash Table (HT) of m memory locations with L as the set of memory addresses (2-digit) of locations in HT. Let the keys in K and addresses in L are Integers. Develop a Program in C that uses Hashfunction H: K→LasH(K)=K mod m(remaindermethod),and implement hashing Technique to map a given key K to the address space L.Resolve the collision(ifany) using linear probing.
